This is one of my personal projects, an Audio Visualizer implemented in C++. This audio visualizer seamlessly merges auditory and visual elements, offering an immersive exhibition of music and various audio sources.



## Key features
* Layering
  This means that you can layer your visualizer in any order you prefer, as of now there are only 3 callbacks implemented.
* Real-time visualization
  This goes by your systems audio, so it will automatically pick up anything and flucuate to the input.
* Easy integration
  Designed for simplicity, the project effortlessly integrates into diverse settings, with well-documented code for accessibility and customization.

## Included visualizer modes
* Heartbeat (syncs the background color of the window to your audios system input.)
* Monkey Bars (Creates a line of bars that all dynamically adapt to the input, making for a cool effect!)
* Energy Ring (A really cool ring that constantly adapts shape based on the input, very sporadic though!)

## Lastly...
### To navigate through the modes, simply right click the window!

I appreciate any interest in this project at all, and I am always open to any feedback and suggestions if you have any! If you're learning like I am and need examples of code to look at, feel free to go ahead! Take anything away from it if you'd like, as it also serves to help others as well as myself. If you intend on changing up anything with it to create a custom copy, let me know in advance! I'd love to hear about it. Thanks so much!
